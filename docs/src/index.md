## Overview

GenX is a highly-configurable, [open source](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/LICENSE) electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.

The model was [originally developed](https://energy.mit.edu/publication/enhanced-decision-support-changing-electricity-landscape/) by [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and [Nestor A. Sepulveda](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/nestor-sepulveda/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by [a team of contributors](https://energy.mit.edu/genx/#team) at the MIT Energy Initiative (led by [Dharik Mallapragada](https://mallapragada.mit.edu)) and the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins).

GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.

GenX features a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/). The model is designed to be highly flexible and configurable for use in a variety of applications from academic research and technology evaluation to public policy and regulatory analysis and resource planning. Depending on the planning problem or question to be studied, GenX can be configured with varying levels of model resolution and scope, with regards to: (1) temporal resolution of time series data such as electricity demand and renewable energy availability; (2) power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints; and (3) geospatial resolution and transmission network representation. The model is also capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources, including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators, energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, demand response, and several advanced technologies such as long-duration energy storage.

## Multi-stage investment planning

In addition to the standard **single-stage planning** mode, in which the produces a single snapshot of the minimum-cost generation capacity mix to meet demand at least cost under some pre-specified future conditions, recent improvements in the GenX source code (part of v0.3 release) enable its use for studying long-term evolution of the power system across multiple investment stages. More information of this feature can be found in the section on `Multi-stage` under the `Model function reference` tab. In brief, GenX can be used to study multi-stage power system planning in the following two ways: 
- The user can formulate and solve a deterministic **multi-stage planning problem with perfect foresight** i.e. demand, cost, and policy assumptions about all stages are known and exploited to determine the least-cost investment trajectory for the entire period. The solution of this multi-stage problem relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described in [Lara et al. 2018 here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304466). 
- The user can formulate a **sequential, myopic multi-stage planning problem**, where the model solves a sequence of single-stage investment planning problems wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized to meet demand given assumptions for the current planning stage and with investment decisions from previous stages treated as inputs for the current stage. We refer to this as "myopic" (or shortsighted) mode since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage. This version is generally more computationally efficient than the deterministic multi-stage expansion with perfect foresight mode.

## Requirements

GenX currently exists in version 0.3.0 and runs only on Julia v1.6.x and v1.5.x series, where x>=0 and a minimum version of JuMP v0.21.x. There is also an older version of GenX, which is also currently maintained and runs on Julia 1.3.x and 1.4.x series (For those users who has previously cloned GenX, and has been running it successfully so far, and therefore might be unwilling to run it on the latest version of Julia: please look into the GitHub branch, [old_version](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/old_version)). It is currently setup to use one of the following open-source freely available solvers: A) [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl) for linear programming (LP) problems and (B) [Cbc](https://github.com/jump-dev/Cbc.jl) for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. We also provide the option to use one of these two commercial solvers: C) [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), and D) [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer). Note that using Gurobi and CPLEX requires a valid license on the host machine. There are two ways to run GenX with either type of solver options (open-source free or, licensed commercial) as detailed in the section, `Running an Instance of GenX`.

The file `julenv.jl` in the parent directory lists all of the packages and their versions needed to run GenX. You can see all of the packages installed in your Julia environment and their version numbers by running `pkg> status` on the package manager command line in the Jula REPL.

## Running an Instance of GenX

Download or clone the GenX repository on your machine in a directory named 'GenX'. Create this new directory in a location where you wish to store the GenXJulEnv environment.

The Run.jl file in each of the example sub-folders within `Example_Systems/` provides an example of how to use GenX.jl for capacity expansion modeling. The following are the main steps performed in the Run.jl script:

1. Establish path to environment setup files and GenX source files.
2. Read in model settings `genx_settings.yml` from the example directory.
3. Configure solver settings.
4. Load the model inputs from the example directory and perform time-domain clustering if required.
5. Generate a GenX model instance.
6. Solve the model.
7. Write the output files to a specified directory.

Here are step-by-step instructions for running Run.jl, following the two slightly different methods:

### Method 1: Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file

1. Start an instance of the Julia kernel from inside the GenX/ folder (which corresponds to the GenX repo, that you've just cloned) by typing `julia --project="GenX"`.
2. Go to the package prompt by typing `]`. You will see that you're within a Julia virtual environment named `(GenX)`. However, at this point, this environment isn't loaded with the dependencies. Type `activate .` to activate the dependecnies in the environment.
3. If it's your first time running GenX (or, if you have pulled after some major upgrades/release/version) run `instantiate` from the `(GenX) pkg` prompt.
4. If you have an old `Manifest.toml` file file at the same file hierarchy as the `Project.toml` file and you get an error while running through the above steps, please delete the existing `Manifest.toml` file and execute steps 1-3 again.
5. In order to make sure that the dependecies have been installed, type `st` in the package prompt.

Execution of the entire sequence of the four steps above should look like the figure below:

![Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Steps 1-4](assets/Method1_Julia_Kernel_from_inside_GenX_Step1_Updated.png)
*Figure.Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Steps 1-4*

6. Type the back key to come back to the `julia>` prompt.
7. Run the script by executing the command `julia> include(“<path to your case>/Run.jl”)`. For example, in order to run the ISONE_Singlezone case within the Example_Systems/RealSystemExample/, type `include("Example_Systems/RealSystemExample/ISONE_Singlezone/Run.jl")` from the `julia>` prompt (while being still in the GenX i.e. the root level in the folder hierarchy)

Execution of the steps 5 and 6 above should look like the figure below:

![Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Steps 5-6](assets/Method1_Julia_Kernel_from_inside_GenX_Step2_Updated.png)
*Figure.Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Steps 5-6*

8. After the script runs to completion, results will be written to a folder called “Results”, also located in the same directory as `Run.jl`.

If however, the user opens a julia kernel, while not yet inside the GenX folder, it's still possible to reach to the GenX folder while being inside the Julia REPL by executing the `pwd()` command first to check where on the directory structure the user is currently, and then by executing the `cd(<path to GenX>)` command. Afterwards, the steps are the same as above. This is shown in the three figures below:

*Figure.Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Steps 5-6*

### Method 2: Creating the Julia environment and installing the dependencies by building the Project.toml files by running activation script

1. Start an instance of the Julia kernel.
2. Make your present working directory to be where the Run.jl is located. To do this, you can use the Julia command `julia> cd(“/path/to/directory/containing/file)`, using the actual pathname of the directory containing Run.jl. Note that all your inputs files should be in this directory in addition to Run.jl. Details about the required input files can be found in the documentation linked above or in the examples provided in the folder `Example_Systems/`. You can check your present working directory by running the command `julia> pwd()`.
3. Uncomment the following lines of code at the beginning of the `Run.jl` file (which is currently commented out):
    `environment_path = "../../../package_activate.jl"`
    `include(environment_path)`
4. Run the script by executing the command `julia> include(“Run.jl”)`.
5. After the script runs to completion, results will be written to a folder called “Results”, also located in the same directory as `Run.jl`.

Note that if you have not already installed the required Julia packages, you are using a version of JuMP other than v0.21.4, or you do not have a valid Gurobi license on your host machine, you will receive an error message and Run.jl will not run to completion.

If you want to use either of Gurobi or CPLEX solvers, instead or Clp or Cbc do the following:

1. Uncomment the relevant lines in the `[deps]` and `[compat]` in the Project.toml file within GenX/ folder. If the CPLEX and/or Gurobi lines are missing, add the following lines to the `[deps]`:
`CPLEX = "a076750e-1247-5638-91d2-ce28b192dca0"`
`Gurobi = "2e9cd046-0924-5485-92f1-d5272153d98b"`
and the following lines to the `[compat]`:
`CPLEX = "0.7.7"`
`Gurobi = "0.9.14"`
depending on whether you are going to use CPLEX or Gurobi, respectively.
2. Uncomment the relevent `using Gurobi` and/or `using CPLEX` at the beginning of the `GenX.jl` file
3. Set the appropriate solver in the `genx_settings.yml` file
4. Make sure you have a valid license and the actual solvers for either of Gurobi or CPLEX installed on your machine

## Running Modeling to Generate Alternatives with GenX

GenX includes a modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) package that can be used to automatically enumerate a diverse set of near cost-optimal solutions to electricity system planning problems. To use the MGA algorithm, user will need to perform the following tasks:

1. Add a `Resource_Type` column in the `Generators_data.csv` file denoting the type of each technology.
2. Add a `MGA` column in the `Generators_data.csv` file denoting the availability of the technology.
3. Set the `ModelingToGenerateAlternatives` flag in the `GenX_Settings.yml` file to 1.
4. Set the `ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack` flag in the `GenX_Settings.yml` file to the desirable level of slack.
5. Solve the model using `Run.jl` file.

Results from the MGA algorithm would be saved in `MGA_max` and `MGA_min` folders in the `Example_Systems/` folder.

## Multi-stage investment planning
Recent improvements in the GenX source code enable its use for studying long-term evolution of the power system across multiple investment stages. More information of this feature can be found in the section on `Multi-stage` under the `Model function reference` tab. In brief, GenX can be used to study multi-stage power system planning in the following two ways: 
- The user can formulate and solve a single deterministic multi-stage investment planning problem with perfect foresight i.e. cost and policy assumptions about all stages are known and exploited to determine the least-cost investment trajectory. The solution of this multi-stage problem relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described [elsewhere](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304466). 
- The user can formulate and solve a sequence of single-stage investment planning wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized, while investment decisions from previous stages treated as fixed. We refer to this as "Myopic" mode of the multi-stage model since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage.


# Limitations of the GenX Model

While the benefits of an openly available generation and transmission expansion model are high, many approximations have been made due to missing data or to manage computational tractability. The assumptions of the GenX model are listed below. It serves as a caveat to the user and as an encouragement to improve the approximations.
## Time period

GenX makes the simplifying assumption that each time period contains n copies of a single, representative year. GenX optimizes generation and transmission capacity for just this characteristic year within each time period, assuming the results for different years in the same time period are identical. However, the GenX objective function accounts only for the cost of the final model time period.
## Cost

The GenX objective function assumes that the cost of powerplants is specified in the unit of currency per unit of capacity. GenX also assumes that the capital cost of technologies is paid through loans.
## Market

GenX is a bottom-up (technology-explicit), partial equilibrium model that assumes perfect markets for commodities. In other words, each commodity is produced such that the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized.
## Technology

Behavioral response and acceptance of new technology are often modeled simplistically as a discount rate or by externally fixing the technology capacity. A higher, technology-specific discount rate represents consumer reluctance to accept newer technologies.
## Uncertainty

Because each model realization assumes a particular state of the world based on the input values drawn, the parameter uncertainty is propagated through the model in the case of myopic model runs
## Decision-making

GenX assumes rational decision making, with perfect information and perfect foresight, and simultaneously optimizes all decisions over the user-specified time horizon.
## Demand

GenX assumes price-elastic demand segments that are represented using piece-wise approximation rather than an inverse demand curve to keep the model linear.

# pygenx: Python interface for GenX

Python users can now run GenX from a thin-python-wrapper interface, developed by [Daniel Olsen](https://github.com/danielolsen). This tool is called `pygenx` and can be cloned from the github page: [pygenx](https://github.com/danielolsen/pygenx). It needs installation of Julia 1.3 and a clone of GenX repo along with your python installation. 

## Simple GenX Case Runner: For automated sequential batch run for GenX

It is now possible to run a list of GenX cases as separate batch jobs. Alternatively, they can also be run locally in sequence, as one job. It has been developed by [Jacob Schwartz](https://github.com/cfe316). This tool is called `SimpleGenXCaseRunner` and can be cloned from the github page: [SimpleGenXCaseRunner](https://github.com/cfe316/SimpleGenXCaseRunner)
