## Overview

GenX is a highly-configurable, [open source](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/LICENSE) electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape. 

The model was [originally developed](https://energy.mit.edu/publication/enhanced-decision-support-changing-electricity-landscape/) by [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and [Nestor A. Sepulveda](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/nestor-sepulveda/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by [a team of contributors](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX#genx-team) at the MIT Energy Initiative (led by [Dharik Mallapragada](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/dharik-mallapragada/)) and the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins). 

GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.

GenX features a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/). The model is designed to be highly flexible and configurable for use in a variety of applications from academic research and technology evaluation to public policy and regulatory analysis and resource planning. Depending on the planning problem or question to be studied, GenX can be configured with varying levels of model resolution and scope, with regards to: (1) temporal resolution of time series data such as electricity demand and renewable energy availability; (2) power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints; and (3) geospatial resolution and transmission network representation. The model is also capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources, including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators, energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, demand response, and several advanced technologies such as long-duration energy storage.

## Requirements

GenX.jl runs on Julia v1.3.0 and JuMP v0.21.3, and is currently setup to use one of the following solvers: A) [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), and B) [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer). Note that using Gurobi and CPLEX requires a valid license on the host machine. Compatibility with open source solvers Clp and [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) will be added shortly. The file `juliaenv.jl` in the parent directory lists all of the packages and their versions needed to run GenX. You can see all of the packages installed in your Julia environment and their version numbers by running `pkg> status` on the package manager command line in the Jula REPL.

You can see all of the packages installed in your Julia environment and their version numbers by running pkg> status on the package manager command line.

## Running an Instance of GenX

Download or clone the GenX repository on your machine in a directory named 'GenX'. Create this new directory in a location where you wish to store the GenXJulEnv environment.

The Run.jl file in each of the example sub-folders within `Example_Systems/` provides an example of how to use GenX.jl for capacity expansion modeling. The following are the main steps performed in the Run.jl script:
1. Establish path to environment setup files and GenX source files.
2. Read in model settings `GenX_Settings.yml` from the example directory.
3.  Configure solver settings.
4. Load the model inputs from the example directory and perform time-domain clustering if required.
5. Generate a GenX model instance.
6. Solve the model.
7. Write the output files to a specified directory.

Here are step-by-step instructions for running Run.jl:
1. Start an instance of the Julia kernel.
2. Make your present working directory to be where the Run.jl is located. To do this, you can use the Julia command `julia> cd(“/path/to/directory/containing/file)`, using the actual pathname of the directory containing Run.jl. Note that all your inputs files should be in this directory in addition to Run.jl. Details about the required input files can be found in the documentation linked above or in the examples provided in the folder `Example_Systems/`. You can check your present working directory by running the command `julia> pwd()`.
3. Run the script by executing the command `julia> include(“Run.jl”)`.
4. After the script runs to completion, results will be written to a folder called “Results”, also located in the same directory as `Run.jl`.

Note that if you have not already installed the required Julia packages, you are using a version of JuMP other than v0.21.4, or you do not have a valid Gurobi license on your host machine, you will receive an error message and Run.jl will not run to completion.

## Running Modeling to Generate Alternatives with GenX
GenX includes a modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) package that can be used to automatically enumerate a diverse set of near cost-optimal solutions to electricity system planning problems. To use the MGA algorithm, user will need to perform the following tasks:

1. Add a `Resource_Type` column in the `Generators_data.csv` file denoting the type of each technology.
2. Add a `MGA` column in the `Generators_data.csv` file denoting the availability of the technology.
3. Set the `ModelingToGenerateAlternatives` flag in the `GenX_Settings.yml` file to 1.
4. Set the `ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack` flag in the `GenX_Settings.yml` file to the desirable level of slack.
5. Create a `Rand_mga_objective_coefficients.csv` file to provide random objective function coefficients for each MGA iteration. For each iteration, number of rows in the `Rand_mga_objective_coefficients.csv` file represents the number of distinct technology types while number of columns represent the number of model zones.
6. Solve the model using `Run.jl` file.

Results from the MGA algorithm would be saved in `MGA_max` and `MGA_min` folders in the `Example_Systems/` folder.
