# GenX Database Documentation

## 1 Model setup parameters

Model settings parameters are specified in a `genx_settings.yml` file which should be located in the current working directory (or to specify an alternative location, edit the `settings_path` variable in your `Run.jl` file).
Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. Model structure related settings parameters affect the formulation of the model constraints and objective function.
Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution.
Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses.
Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

which should be located in the current working directory.
Note that GenX supplies default settings for most solver settings in the various solver-specific functions found in the `src/configure_solver/` directory.
To overwrite default settings, you can specify the below Solver specific settings.
Settings are specific to each solver.

## 2 Inputs

All input files are in CSV format. Running the GenX model requires a minimum of five input files. Additionally, the user may need to specify five more input files based on model configuration and type of scenarios of interest. Description and column details of all potential input files are included in the `Input_data_explained` folder in the `Example_Systems` folder. Names of the input files and their functionality is also given below. Note that names of the input files are case sensitive.

### 2.1 Mandatory input data


#### 2.1.1 Fuels\_data.csv

• **First row:** names of all fuels used in the model instance which should match the labels used in `Fuel` column in the `Generators_data.csv` file. For renewable resources or other resources that do not consume a fuel, the name of the fuel is `None`.

• **Second row:** The second row specifies the CO2 emissions intensity of each fuel in tons/MMBtu (million British thermal units). Note that by convention, tons correspond to metric tonnes and not short tons (although as long as the user is internally consistent in their application of units, either can be used).

• **Remaining rows:** Rest of the rows in this input file specify the time-series for prices for each fuel in $/MMBtu. A constant price can be specified by entering the same value for all hours.

* ** First column:** The first column in this file denotes, Time\_index, represents the index of time steps in a model instance.


#### 2.1.2 Network.csv

This input file contains input parameters related to: 1) definition of model zones (regions between which transmission flows are explicitly modeled) and 2) definition of transmission network topology, existing capacity, losses and reinforcement costs. The following table describe each of the mandatory parameter inputs need to be specified to run an instance of the model, along with comments for the model configurations when they are needed.

###### Table 3: Structure of the Network.csv file
---
|**Column Name** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|**Settings-specific Columns**|
|**Multiple zone model**||

There are two interfaces implemented for specifying the network topology itself: a matrix interface and a list interface.
Only one choice is permitted in a given file.

The list interface consists of a column for the lines origin zone and one for the line's destination zone.
Here is a snippet of the Network.csv file for a map with three zones and two lines:
```
Network_Lines, Origin_Zone, Destination_Zone,
            1,           1,                2,
            2,           1,                3,
```

The matrix interface requires N columns labeled `z1, z2, z3 ... zN`,
and L rows, one for each network line (or interregional path), with a `1` in the column corresponding to the 'origin' zone 
and a `-1` in the column corresponding to the 'destination' zone for each line.
Here is the same network map implemented as a matrix:
```
Network_Lines, z1, z2, z3,
            1,  1, -1,  0,
            2,  1,  0, -1,
```

Note that in either case, positive flows indicate flow from origin to destination zone;
negative flows indicate flow from destination to origin zone.


#### 2.1.3 Demand\_data.csv (Load\_data.csv)

This file includes parameters to characterize model temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations, electricity demand for each time step for each zone, and cost of load shedding. Note that GenX is designed to model hourly time steps. With some care and effort, finer (e.g. 15 minute) or courser (e.g. 2 hour) time steps can be modeled so long as all time-related parameters are scaled appropriately (e.g. time period weights, heat rates, ramp rates and minimum up and down times for generators, variable costs, etc).

###### Table 4: Structure of the Demand\_data.csv file
---
|**Column Name** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|**Mandatory Columns**|
|Voll |Value of lost load (also referred to as non-served energy) in $/MWh.|
|Demand\_Segment |Number of demand curtailment/unserved demand segments with different cost and capacity of curtailable demand for each segment. User-specified demand segments. Integer values starting with 1 in the first row. Additional segements added in subsequent rows.|
|Cost\_of\_Demand\_Curtailment\_per\_MW |Cost of non-served energy/demand curtailment (for each segment), reported as a fraction of value of the lost load (non-served demand). If *Demand\_Segment = 1*, then this parameter is a scalar and equal to one. In general this parameter is a vector of length equal to the length of Demand\_Segment.|
|Max\_Demand\_Curtailment| Maximum time-dependent demand curtailable in each segment, reported as % of the demand in each zone and each period. *If Demand\_Segment = 1*, then this parameter is a scalar and equal to one. In general this parameter is a vector of length given by length of Demand\_segment.|
|Time\_Index |Index defining time step in the model.|
|Demand\_MW\_z* |Demand profile of a zone z* in MW; if multiple zones, this parameter will be a matrix with columns equal to number of zones (each column named appropriate zone number appended to parameter) and rows equal to number of time periods of grid operations being modeled.|
|Rep\_Periods |Number of representative periods (e.g. weeks, days) that are modeled to approximate annual grid operations. This is always a single entry. For a full-year model, this is `1`.|
|Timesteps\_per\_Rep\_Period |Number of timesteps per representative period (e.g. 168 if period is set as a week using hour-long time steps). This is always a single entry: all representative periods have the same length. For a full-year model, this entry is equal to the number of time steps.|
|Sub\_Weights |Number of annual time steps (e.g. hours) represented by each timestep in a representative period. The length of this column is equal to the number of representative periods. The sum of the elements should be equal to the total number of time steps in a model time horizon (e.g. 8760 hours if modeling 365 days or 8736 if modeling 52 weeks).|



#### 2.1.4 Generator\_variability.csv

This file contains the time-series of capacity factors / availability of each resource included in the `Generators_data.csv` file for each time step (e.g. hour) modeled.

• First column: The first column contains the time index of each row (starting in the second row) from 1 to N.

• Second column onwards: Resources are listed from the second column onward with headers matching each resource name in the `Generators_data.csv` file in any order. The availability for each resource at each time step is defined as a fraction of installed capacity and should be between 0 and 1. Note that for this reason, resource names specified in `Generators_data.csv` must be unique. Note that for Hydro reservoir resources (i.e. `HYDRO = 1` in the `Generators_data.csv`), values in this file correspond to inflows (in MWhs) to the hydro reservoir as a fraction of installed power capacity, rather than hourly capacity factor. Note that for co-located VRE and storage resources, solar PV and wind resource profiles should not be located in this file but rather in separate variability files (these variabilities can be in the `Generators_variability.csv` if time domain reduction functionalities will be utilized because the time domain reduction functionalities will separate the files after the clustering is completed).

#### 2.1.5 Generators\_data.csv

This file contains cost and performance parameters for various generators and other resources (storage, flexible demand, etc) included in the model formulation.

###### Table 5: Mandatory columns in the Generators\_data.csv file
---
|**Column Name** | **Description**|
| :------------ | :-----------|
|Resource | This column contains **unique** names of resources available to the model. Resources can include generators, storage, and flexible or time shiftable demand.|
|Zone | Integer representing zone number where the resource is located. |
|**Technology type flags**|
|New\_Build | {-1, 0, 1}, Flag for resource (storage, generation) eligibility for capacity expansion.|

||New\_Build = 0: not eligible for capacity expansion, eligible for retirement.|
||New\_Build = -1: not eligible for capacity expansion or retirement.|
|THERM | {0, 1, 2}, Flag to indicate membership in set of thermal resources (e.g. nuclear, combined heat and power, natural gas combined cycle, coal power plant)|
||THERM = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||THERM = 1: If the power plant relies on thermal energy input and subject unit commitment constraints/decisions if `UCommit >= 1` (e.g. cycling decisions/costs/constraints). |
||THERM = 2: If the power plant relies on thermal energy input and is subject to simplified economic dispatch constraints (ramping limits and minimum output level but no cycling decisions/costs/constraints). |
|Cap\_size | Size (MW) of a single generating unit. This is used only for resources with integer unit commitment (`THERM = 1`) - not relevant for other resources.|
|VRE | {0, 1}, Flag to indicate membership in set of dispatchable (or curtailable) variable renewable energy resources (onshore wind, offshore wind, utility-scale solar PV, and distributed solar PV subject to dispatch signals).|
||VRE = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||VRE = 1: Dispatchable variable renewable energy (VRE) resources. |
|Num\_VRE\_bins | Number of resource availability profiles considered for each VRE resource per zone. This parameter is used to decide the number of capacity investment decision variables related to a single variable renewable energy technology in each zone.|
||Num\_VRE\_bins = 1: using a single resource availability profile per technology per zone. 1 capacity investment decision variable and 1 generator RID tracking technology power output (and in each zone).|
||Num\_VRE\_bins > 1: using multiple resource availability profiles per technology per zone. Num\_VRE\_bins capacity investment decision variables and 1 generator RID used to define technology power output at each time step (and in each zone). Example: Suppose we are modeling 3 bins of wind profiles for each zone. Then include 3 rows with wind resource names as Wind\_1, Wind\_2, and Wind\_3 and a corresponding increasing sequence of RIDs. Set Num\_VRE\_bins for the generator with smallest RID, Wind\_1, to be 3 and set Num\_VRE\_bins for the other rows corresponding to Wind\_2 and Wind\_3, to be zero. By setting Num\_VRE\_bins for Wind\_2 and Wind\_3, the model eliminates the power outputs variables for these generators. The power output from the technology across all bins is reported in the power output variable for the first generator. This allows for multiple bins without significantly increasing number of model variables (adding each bin only adds one new capacity variable and no operational variables). See documentation for `curtailable_variable_renewable()` for more. |
|MUST\_RUN | {0, 1}, Flag to indicate membership in set of must-run plants (could be used to model behind-the-meter PV not subject to dispatch signals/curtailment, run-of-river hydro that cannot spill water, must-run or self-committed thermal generators, etc). |
||MUST\_RUN = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||MUST\_RUN = 1: Must-run (non-dispatchable) resources.|
|STOR | {0, 1, 2}, Flag to indicate membership in set of storage resources and designate which type of storage resource formulation to employ.|
||STOR = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||STOR = 1: Discharging power capacity and energy capacity are the investment decision variables; symmetric charge/discharge power capacity with charging capacity equal to discharging capacity (e.g. lithium-ion battery storage).|
||STOR = 2: Discharging, charging power capacity and energy capacity are investment variables; asymmetric charge and discharge capacities using distinct processes (e.g. hydrogen electrolysis, storage, and conversion to power using fuel cell or combustion turbine).|
|FLEX | {0, 1}, Flag to indicate membership in set of flexible demand-side resources (e.g. scheduleable or time shiftable demand such as automated EV charging, smart thermostat systems, irrigation pumping demand etc).|
||FLEX = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||FLEX = 1: Flexible demand resource.|
|HYDRO | {0, 1}, Flag to indicate membership in set of reservoir hydro resources.|
||HYDRO = 0: Not part of set (default) |
||HYDRO = 1: Hydropower with reservoir modeling, including inflows, spillage, ramp rate limits and minimum operating level and efficiency loss associated with discharging. Reservoir capacity can be represented as a ratio or energy to power. This type of plant cannot charge from grid.|

### 2.2 Optional inputs files

#### 2.2.1 Online Time-domain reduction

Modeling grid operations for each hour of the year can be computationally expensive for models with many zones and resources. Time-domain reduction is often employed in capacity expansion models as a way to balance model spatial and temporal resolution as well as representation of dispatch, while ensuring reasonable computational times. GenX allows the option of performing time-domain reduction on the user supplied time-series input data to produce a representative time series at the desired level of temporal resolution. The below table summarizes the list of parameters to be specified by the user to perform the time domain reduction implemented in GenX. These parameters are passed to GenX via the YAML file `time_domain_reduction_settings.yml`.

| :------------ | :-----------|
|Timesteps\_per\_period | The number of timesteps (e.g., hours) in each representative period (i.e. 168 for weeks, 24 for days, 72 for three-day periods, etc).|
|UseExtremePeriods | 1 = Include outliers (by performance or demand/resource extreme) as their own representative extreme periods. This setting automatically includes periods based on criteria outlined in the dictionary `ExtremePeriods`. Extreme periods can be selected based on following criteria applied to demand profiles or solar and wind capacity factors profiles, at either the zonal or system level. A) absolute (timestep with min/max value) statistic (minimum, maximum) and B) integral (period with min/max summed value) statistic (minimum, maximum). For example, the user could want the hour with the most demand across the whole system to be included among the extreme periods. They would select Demand, System, Absolute, and Max.|
||0 = Do not include extreme periods.|
|ExtremePeriods | If UseExtremePeriods = 1, use this dictionary to select which types of extreme periods to use. Select by profile type (Demand, PV, or Wind), geography (Zone or System), grouping by timestep or by period (Absolute or Integral), and statistic (Maximum or Minimum).|

|ScalingMethod |Either ‘N' or ‘S', the decision to normalize ([0,1]) or standardize (mean 0, variance 1) the input data prior to clustering.|
|MinPeriods |The minimum number of representative periods used to represent the input data. If using UseExtremePeriods, this must be greater or equal to the number of selected extreme periods. If `IterativelyAddPeriods` is off, this will be the total number of representative periods.|
|MaxPeriods| The maximum number of representative periods - both clustered and extreme - that may be used to represent the input data.|
|IterativelyAddPeriods |1 = Add representative periods until the error threshold between input data and represented data is met or the maximum number of representative periods is reached.|
||0 = Use only the minimum number of representative periods. This minimum value includes the selected extreme periods if `UseExtremePeriods` is on.|
|Threshold |Iterative period addition will end if the period farthest from its representative period (as measured using Euclidean distance) is within this percentage of the total possible error (for normalization) or 95% of the total possible error (± 2 σ for standardization). E.g., for a threshold of 0.01, each period must be within 1% of the spread of possible error before the clustering iterations will terminate (or until the maximum is reached).|
|IterateMethod | Either ‘cluster' (Default) or ‘extreme', whether to increment the number of clusters to the kmeans/kmedoids method or to set aside the worst-fitting periods as a new extreme periods.|
|nReps |Default 200, the number of kmeans/kmedoids repetitions at the same setting.|
|DemandWeight| Default 1, a multiplier on demand columns to optionally prioritize better fits for demand profiles over resource capacity factor or fuel price profiles.|
|WeightTotal |Default 8760, the sum to which the relative weights of representative periods will be scaled.|
|ClusterFuelPrices| Either 1 or 0, whether or not to use the fuel price time series in `Fuels_data.csv` in the clustering process. If 'no', this function will still write `Fuels_data.csv` in the TimeDomainReductionFolder with reshaped fuel prices based on the number and size of the representative periods but will not use the fuel price time series for selection of representative periods.|

6. num\_trajectory should be approximately equal to the total number of uncertain parameters
7. len\_design_mat should be 1.5 to 2 times the total number of uncertain parameters
8. Higher number of num\_trajectory and len_design_mat would lead to higher accuracy

### 3.2 Settings-specific outputs

This section includes the output files that GenX will print if corresponding function is specified in the Settings.


#### 3.2.1 CapacityValue.csv

This file includes the time-dependent capacity value calculated for each generator. GenX will print this file only if the capacity reserve margin constraints are modeled through the setting file. Each row of the file (excluding the header) corresponds to a generator specified in the inputs. Each column starting from the t1 to the second last one stores the result of capacity obligation provided in each hour divided by the total capacity. Thus the number is unitless. If the capacity margin reserve is not binding for one hour, GenX will return zero. The last column specified the name of the corresponding capacity reserve constraint. Note that, if the user calculates the hour-weight-averaged capacity value for each generator using data of the binding hours, the result is what RTO/ISO call capacity credit.

#### 3.2.2 ExportRevenue.csv

This file includes the export revenue in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step-weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time-step, the export revenue is calculated as the net outbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this export revenue is already part of the generation revenue, and the user should not double count.


#### 3.2.3 Importcost.csv

This file includes the import cost in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step -weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time step, the import cost is calculated as the net inbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this import cost is already part of the load payment, and the user should not double count.

#### 3.2.2 EnergyRevenue.csv

This file includes the energy revenue in $ earned by each generator through injecting into the grid. Only annual sum values are available.


#### 3.2.3 ChargingCost.csv

This file includes the charging cost  in $ of earned by each generator through withdrawing from the grid. Only annual sum values are available.


#### 3.2.4 ReserveMargin.csv

This file includes the shadow prices of the capacity reserve margin constraints. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver, as described earlier. Each row (except the header) corresponds to a capacity reserve margin constraint, and each column corresponds to an time step. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.


#### 3.2.5 ReserveMarginRevenue.csv

This file includes the capacity revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue from each capacity reserve margin constraint. The revenue is calculated as the capacity contribution of each time steps multiplied by the shadow price, and then the sum is taken over all modeled time steps. The last column is the total revenue received from all capacity reserve margin constraints. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.


#### 3.2.6 ESR\_prices.csv

This file includes the renewable/clean energy credit price of each modeled RPS/CES constraint. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. The unit is $/MWh.


#### 3.2.7 ESR\_Revenue.csv

This file includes the renewable/clean credit revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue earned from each RPS constraint. The revenue is calculated as the total annual generation (if elgible for the corresponding constraint) multiplied by the RPS/CES price. The last column is the total revenue received from all constraint. The unit is $.


#### 3.2.8 SubsidyRevenue.csv

This file includes subsidy revenue earned if a generator specified Min\_Cap is provided in the input file. GenX will print this file only the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Do not confuse this with the Minimum Capacity Carveout constraint, which is for a subset of generators, and a separate revenue term will be calculated in other files. The unit is $.

#### 3.2.9 vre_stor_capacity.csv
