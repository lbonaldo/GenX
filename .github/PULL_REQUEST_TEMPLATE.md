## Checklist

- [ ] Code changes are sufficiently documented; i.e. new functions contain docstrings and .md files under /docs/src have been updated if necessary.
- [ ] The latest changes on the target branch have been incorporated, so that any conflicts are taken care of before merging. This can be accomplished either by merging in the target branch (e.g. 'git merge develop') or by rebasing on top of the target branch (e.g. 'git rebase develop'). Please do not hesitate to reach out to the GenX development team if you need help with this.
- [ ] Code has been tested to ensure all functionality works as intended.
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md has been updated (if this is a 'notable' change).
- [ ] I consent to the release of this PR's code under the GNU General Public license.

## How this can be tested

<!--
  For Work In Progress Pull Requests, please use the Draft PR feature,
  see https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/ for further details.
  
  For a timely review/response, please avoid force-pushing additional
  commits if your PR already received reviews or comments.
  After the PR is approved we will give you a chance to tidy up the branch before merging.
  
  Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure you've done the following:
  - 👷‍♀️ Create small PRs. In most cases, this will be possible. In the case of large feature or module additions, it is best to work towards a "minimum viable product" that is thoroughly tested but may not have all desired functionality or features, make a PR for this, and then later work to add more features.
  - 📝 Use descriptive commit messages.
  - 📗 Update any related documentation.
