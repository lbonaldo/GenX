MacOrWindows: Mac  # Set to either "Mac" (also works for Linux) or "Windows" to ensure use of proper file directory separator "\" or "/
PrintModel: 0 # 1 = including the model equation as an output; 0 = the model equation not being included as an output
NetworkExpansion: 0 # 1 = active otherwise no active
Trans_Loss_Segments: 1 # Number of segments to use in piecewise linear approximation of losses; 1 = linear, >2 = piecewise quadratic
Reserves: 0 # 0 = no operating reserves, 1 regulation (primary) and operating (secondary) reserves
EnergyShareRequirement: 0 # Minimum qualifying renewables penetration; 0 = not active; 1 = active systemwide
CapacityReserveMargin: 0 # Number of capacity reserve margin constraints; 0 = not active; 1 = active systemwide
CO2Cap: 2 # CO2 emissions cap; 0 = not active; 1 = active per note; 2 = active systemwide;
StorageLosses: 1 # Energy Share Requirement and CO2 constraints account for energy lost; 0 = not active (DO NOT account for energy lost); 1 = active systemwide (DO account for energy lost)
MinCapReq: 0  # Activate minimum technology carveout constraints; 0 = not active; 1 = active
Solver: Gurobi # Available solvers: Gurobi, CPLEX, CLPs
ParameterScale: 1 # Flag to turn on parameter scaling wherein load, capacity and power variables defined in GW rather than MW. 1- scaling done, 0- use input as it is.
WriteShadowPrices: 1 # 1 = get shadow prices of LP or relaxed MILP; 0 = dont compute shadow prices of various constraints
UCommit: 2 # 0 = no Unit Commitment, 1 = integer clestering, 2 = linearized clustering
OperationWrapping: 1 # Sets temporal resolution of the model; 0 = single period to represent the full Year, with first-Last time step linked; 1 = Multiple representative periods;
LongDurationStorage: 1 # 1- allow inter-period energy exchange for storage technologies; 0 - no energy exchange across periods allowed for storage technologies
TimeDomainReductionFolder: "TDR_Results1" # Folder where results from TDR will be saved. If results already exist here, these will be used without running TDR again.
TimeDomainReduction: 1 # 1 = Use time domain reduced (``\_clustered.csv'') inputs based on Load\_data.csv, Generators\_variability.csv, and (optionally) Fuels\_data.csv; 0 = Use input data as provided
ModelingToGenerateAlternatives: 0 # 1 =activate modeling to generate alternative module; 0 = modeling to generate alternative solutions not active - model produces a single solution as output.
ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack: 0.1 # slack value as a fraction of least-cost objective in budget constraint used for evaluating alternative model solutions
