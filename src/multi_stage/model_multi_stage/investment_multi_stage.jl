	function investment_discharge_multi_stage(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, multi_stage_settings::Dict)

This function defines the expressions and constraints keeping track of total available power generation/discharge capacity across all resources as well as constraints on capacity retirements, compatible with multi-stage modeling. It includes all of the variables, expressions, and constraints of investmen\_discharge() with additional constraints and variables introduced for compatibility with multi-stage modeling, which are described below.

Total Capacity Linking Variables and Constraints:

  * The linking variable vEXISTINGCAP[y] for $y \in \mathcal{G}$ is introduced and replaces occurrences of the parameter Existing\_Cap\_MW ($\bar{\Delta}_{y,z}$) in all expressions and constraints in investment\_discharge().
  * The linking constraint cExistingCap[y] for $y \in \mathcal{G}$  is introduced, which is used to link end discharge capacity from stage $p$ to start discharge capacity in stage $p+1$. When $p=1$, the constraint sets vEXISTINGCAP[y] = $\bar{\Delta}_{y,z}$.

Scaling Down the Objective Function Contribution:

  * The contribution of eTotalCFix ($\sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} \left((\pi^{INVEST}_{y,z} \times \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \times  \Omega_{y,z}) + (\pi^{FOM}_{y,z} \times \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \times  \Delta^{total}_{y,z})\right)$) is scaled down by the factor $\sum_{p=1}^{\mathcal{P}} \frac{1}{(1+WACC)^{p-1}}$, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the length of each stage and $WACC$ is the weighted average cost of capital, before it is added to the objective function (these costs will be scaled back to their correct value by the method initialize\_cost\_to\_go()).

Endogenous Retirements Linking Variables and Constraints:
  * The linking variables vCAPTRACK[y,p] and vRETCAPTRACKE[y,p] for $y \in \mathcal{G}, p \in  \mathcal{P}$ are introduced, which represent the cumulative capacity additions and retirements from previous model stages, respectively.
  * Linking constraints which enforce endogenous retirements using the vCAPTRACK and vRETCAPTRACK variables.
  * The constraint enforces that total retirements by stage p should atleast equal the sum of the user specified value + new capacity build in prior stages that reach their end of life before end of stage p. See Equation 18-21 of  Lara et al, Deterministic electric power infrastructure planning: Mixed-integer programming model and nested decomposition algorithm, EJOR, 271(3), 1037-1054, 2018 for further discussion.

inputs:

  * EP – JuMP model.
  * inputs – Dictionary object containing model inputs dictionary generated by load\_inputs().
  * multi\_stage\_settings - Dictionary containing settings dictionary configured in the multi-stage settings file multi\_stage\_settings.yml.

returns: JuMP model with updated variables, expressions, and constraints.
