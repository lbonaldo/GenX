	configure_solver(solver::String, solver_settings_path::String)

This method returns a solver-specific MathOptInterface OptimizerWithAttributes optimizer instance to be used in the GenX.generate\_model() method.

The "solver" argument is a string which specifies the solver to be used. It is not case sensitive.
Currently supported solvers include: "Gurobi", "CPLEX", "Clp", "Cbc", or "SCIP"

The "solver\_settings\_path" argument is a string which specifies the path to the directory that contains the settings YAML file for the specified solver.
