#
#  Pre-Cluster
#
#  Clustering will run within GenX automatically if using the TimeDomainReduction parameter
#  in the settings file and if there are no pre-existing clustered inputs in the
#  directory, but you can use this to cluster independently beforehand or to
#  investigate the clustering process and results.
#
#  Run with the following:
#    include("PreCluster.jl")
#
#  Beforehand, set the following parameters in this file:
#    REQUIRED
#    1) inpath -- The directory where the input data is stored
#    OPTIONAL
#    2) v -- True or False, verbosity
